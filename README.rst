ASTEROIDS
=========

Last week, at work, we joked about creating an Asteroids clone where every
asteroid had a bug number in it, as a bit of a joke. (Ha ha, every bug you
kill spawns two more!)

I was bored this afternoon, so here's a port of Asteroids to JS/Canvas.

Now all I need to do is hook in the bug numbers.


Gameplay
========

You're the triangle in the middle. You want to destroy the circles. You have
a gun (spacebar), some thrusters to turn (left and right arrow keys) and an
engine (up arrow key).

Remember, it's kill or be killed out there.


Rights
======

The name *Asteroids* is, as far as I know, still property of Atari. I mean no
ill-will towards Atari by releasing this code. Frankly, it's a poor 
substitute for anything resembling a real game. I just wanted to see if I
could do it.

If anyone from Atari asks, I will gladly rename and/or remove this code. But
since there are so many *Asteroids* clones as it is, and the original was
released in 1979, and it was kind of a copy of *Spacewar!*, I doubt they'll
mind too much.


Strikes me as funny...
======================

The original *Spacewar!*, one of the earliest (if not the original) computer
games, took `200 hours to code <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!>`_.

This probably took me 6.

I am so glad we've moved past the PDP-1.
